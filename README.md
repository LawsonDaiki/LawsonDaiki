### Hi there 👋

My name is Lawson! 😁 

In March of 2020, I started studying programming in Harvard's CS50 course and felt in love with coding 🌟

My focus is to be a excellent software enginner :grin: I work at Aion Solution as a Django/Python developer, building new features, making integrations with ERPs and writing tests with Pytest :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

I have a degree in Civil Engineering at the Universidade de São Paulo. Currently working as a software engineer :blush:

I was born and raised in São Paulo(Brazil). My family is originally from Japan :yum:
