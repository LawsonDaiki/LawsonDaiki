### Hi there 👋

My name is Lawson! 😁 

In March of 2020, I started studying programming in Harvard's CS50 course and felt in love with coding 🌟

My focus is to be a mobile developer. You can see in my repositories that I've made some mobile apps using React Native :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

I have a degree in Civil Engineering and had been working with product design and CNC machines :blush:

I was born and raised in São Paulo(Brazil). My family is originally from Japan :yum:

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React Native
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Mobile Development
- 💬 Ask me about HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Django
